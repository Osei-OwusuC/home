		<p class="headpara"> Soccer, also known as football, is the arguably the best sport in the world.  Soccer can be played almost anywhere and almost on any terrain.  
		    In soccer two teams of 11 players play for 90 minutes trying to score in each other&rsquo;s neat.

		    About 265 people in world play soccer professionally, that is around 4&#37; of the population. 
			More than 207 countries are a part of FIFA (F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Football Association), which is more than members than the UN.
 </p>
		<h2 id= "History" class = "center" > History	</h2>
		<p class="headpara"> People have been playing versions of soccer for thousands of years and it has evolved many times. No one knows exactly where soccer originated, but historians found that a version of soccer was played in ancient times. 
		    Then soccer continued into the Medieval Times, where it started to become popular. And now we have modern soccer with established rules, but soccer still continues to evolve. </p>
		<h3 class= "subhead">Ancient Soccer	</h3>
		<p> Soccer is a simple sport and the basics of soccer have been on Earth for many years. Early versions soccer was first played in ancient Rome and China. Soccer in ancient china is the most similar version to modern soccer.
		    China had a game called cuju <!--Cuju is a chinese word--> which means &ldquo;kick the ball with foot&rdquo;, two teams of two to ten try to score on the other team net. In cuju <!--Cuju is a chinese word--> players were not allowed to use their hands.
			This game was like a training method for soldiers in the military. In Rome, they had two teams of 27, and the objective was to score in the opponentâ€™s neat. </p>
		<h3 class= "subhead">Medieval Times Soccer	</h3>
		<p> Soccer continued to be played in the Medieval Times. English people are credited to keeping the sport going through the Medieval Times.
		    The sport became really popular in the mid-14th century. Soccer in these days were more violent, anything was allowed as long as it doesn&rsquo;t led to manslaughter. 
		    That means there was more biting, punching and hitting. Soccer games in this era tend to end in riots, so it was banned. 
            The ban did not stop people from playing soccer and at the end of the century it was embedded into their culture. </p> 
		<h3 class= "subhead">Modern Soccer		</h3>
		<p> The soccer that is played now is called Modern soccer. In the early 1860s British clubs started making rules, but every club had different rules.
		    To resolve this problem, twelve clubs came together to establish rules, forming the Football Association.
            After they created the rules, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England created a group called IFAB (International Football Association Board) that reviews and changes the rules each year.
			From there soccer started being played in other European countries, like Spain and France, which lead to the creation of FIFA (f&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale de football association) in 1904.
			In 1913, IFAB joined FIFA. </p>
		<h4 id="Rules">Rules and Objective </h4>
		<p> The main objective of soccer has not changed too much over the year. The objective is to shoot on the opponent&rsquo;s net without using your hands.
		    Soccer is now played with two teams of eleven. Like everything throughout time, the rules of soccer has changed. There is now <a href= "http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/02/79/92/44/laws.of.the.game.2016.2017_neutral.pdf"> 17 main rules </a> to soccer:
